    <h2>Confessions from My Heart</h2>
    <div class="notes-container">
      <div class="note">Mathu, there were nights I stayed up until sunrise writing about you in my notes. I was so lost, so tired of everything, but the thought of you kept me pushing forward.</div>
      <div class="note">I remember staring at your profile picture for hours, whispering to myself that I can’t lose you. That no matter how much it hurt, I’d hold on to us forever.</div>
      <div class="note">When Rida told my parents and we couldn’t talk, I felt like I lost a part of myself, I wrote pages in my notes app begging for time to pass, for you to stay. I thought you’d stop loving me. but I couldn’t stop loving you.</div>
      <div class="note">I told myself: “Just one more day, just survive one more day. You’ll hear her voice again. You’ll feel her love again.” You’re the reason I’m still here.</div>
      <div class="note">I’ve never felt pain like that before, but I’ve also never felt love like this. That phase taught me that what we have is stronger than anything in this world.</div>
      <div class="note">You’ve been my lifeline. You saved me when I couldn’t save myself. Mathu, I owe you my heart, my happiness, my life.</div>
      <div class="note">I love you more than words could ever hold. More than all the tears I cried missing you. More than all the nights I spent writing about you. More than anything.</div>
      <div class="note">This is more than love, Mathu. You are the reason I stayed. You’re the proof that even in my darkest days, something beautiful was waiting for me. :heart:</div>
